Hi,

I hope this message finds you well.

I am Sahil Chandel, a Machine Learning Engineer 1+ YOE with expertise in Computer Vision, NLP, Generative AI, and AI-driven automation solutions. Currently, I am working at GarudaUAV Soft Solution where I have developed and deployed scalable ML models, automated inspection processes, and built AI solutions that significantly reduced manual efforts and improved efficiency.

My experience includes:
- Developing drone-based automated inspection systems for organizations like NHAI and NTPC.
- Building a Conversational PDF Assistant capable of analyzing large documents efficiently using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).
- Working with advanced frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, HuggingFace, LangChain, and MLOps tools like Docker and BentoML.

I am passionate about leveraging AI and Machine Learning to solve complex, real-world problems and would love to explore potential opportunities within your organization. I have attached my resume for your review and would be thrilled to connect and discuss how I can contribute to your team.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best regards,
Sahil Chandel
